    <h4 style= "font-family:garamond, georgia, serif; color:#050505;"> Adjective Ordering in the Visual World </h4>
    <p style= "font-family:garamond, georgia, serif; color:#050505;">Previous work has shown that attributive adjectives in English are ordered in specific ways. Various theories have been proposed for what properties govern this ordering but one of the most broad and also productive divisions places adjectives in the three semantic categories of subsective, intersective, and privative with these categories being ordered privative>subsective>intersective>noun within nominal phrases. For example take the sentences shown in 1 and 2. The example shown in 1 exhibits a perfectly fine subsective (big) > intersective (white) ordering however when that ordering is flipped as in 2 the ordering and sentence suddenly sound off.</p>
    <p style= "font-family:garamond, georgia, serif; color:#050505;">(1) The big white horse charges<br>(2) ?The white big horse charges</p>
    <p style= "font-family:garamond, georgia, serif; color:#050505;">The fact that there is a preferred order begs the question of why is there a preference for any ordering in English? It has also been shown previously that adjective are comprehended incrementally, that is as they occur linearly. The current study uses that feature of incremental comprehension and focuses on where attention is in a visual world display when given normally ordered adjective stimuli versus flipped order adjective stimuli. The hope is that by comparing these contrasting situations more can be learned about how the incremental comprehension of adjectives works and why adjective ordering matters/exists in English. This is an ongoing project I am working on in conjuction with Dr. Helena Aparicio.</p>

    <h4 style= "font-family:garamond, georgia, serif; color:#050505;"> Hittite Adjective Ordering (Undergraduate Thesis) </h4>
    <p style= "font-family:garamond, georgia, serif; color:#050505;">In the Anatolian language of Hittite attributive adjectives are found both pre and postnominally. Previous work posited the prenominal position as the standard position for attributive adjectives with the postnominal position being only for exceptions and participles. Due to the number of exceptions included, that theory seemed ripe for reevaluation. Through analysis of diachronic sources of Hittite I reanalyze the prenominal position as a place for subsective adjectives and the postnominal position as a place for intersective adjectives which includes the so called "exceptions" as well as participles. This is hopefully just the first step towards fully analyzing the details of Hittite nominal phrase syntax.</p>
