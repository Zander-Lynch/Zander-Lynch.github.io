        <p>Hi, my name is Zander Lynch and I am a 2nd year PhD student in the Department of Linguistics at Cornell University. My undergraduate education was at the University of Massachusetts, 
        Amherst where I completed a BA in Linguistics, a BS in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and a minor in Latin in 2023.</p>
        <p>My research interests are centered in the subfields of psycholinguistics, semantics, and historical linguistics, where I use various methodologies 
        including eyetracking and corpus analysis to examine questions about adjectives and their role in integrating information into linguistic processing. 
        My current work is focused on how adjectives in multiple adjective strings are processed. I am also working on the effects of adjectives on the 
        percieved proto-role properties of argument-predicate pairs. A more in-depth description of these projects can be found on 
        the <a style="color:#050505" href="./research.html">research</a> page.</p>
